/**************
**** RULES ****
***************

----
DO's

All styles should be set using the BEM naming convention
eg .block__element {color: #FFFF00;}

Individual areas should have their own overriding scss file, (e.g _homepage.scss & _nudge.scss)

File naming: seperate scss files should have an _ infront of it, this prevents them being compiled into their own CSS file. (This can be ignored when adding it to the includes bellow).

Page styles should only be used as overrides for the main styles. ask yourself if this could be used elsewhere, if so, then it should go in '_commons.scss'

Start your 'page' stylesheeds with the body class of that page. This will allow overrides and all non-essential CSS will be skipped when read.


----
DONT's

NEVER user !imporant. If you need to use !important, then you're covering for bad CSS. BEM should remove all need for this.

NEVER style an ID (e.g. #idName). Styles should be reusable, ID's are not.

NEVER style to a DOM element (e.g. div{border: 1px solid #f00); ) - these should all be covered in the _base.scss.

use clearfix. There is now a ".group" class which works wonders.


----
AVOID

Avoid setting a z-index on constantly static components.
It should only be used on dynamic elements such as modals or dropdowns which are hidden again once interaction has ceased.
(e.g. .main__header{z-index: 999})
